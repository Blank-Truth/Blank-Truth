## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an autodidactic Software Engineer. The idea of thinking up a random idea and the proceeding build it from scratch has always excited me to no end and that is why I aspired to become an engineer. This concept[the ability to literarily create any thing you imagine] is what I am passionate about and what inspires me and gives me hope for the future. My Ultimate aim is to Eliminate Human Error, I want to advance technology to the point where humanity has a God-like level of precision in every realm of endeavor and that is why I would like to work on any and all Projects the bring me even a millimeter closer to this Ultimate goal.
